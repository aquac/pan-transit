Pan Transit is an application for Sailfish OS to view departures from
public transport stops. It is designed to support multiple different
providers (i.e. cities/regions). For current support, look under the
[`providers`](providers) directory.

Pan Transit is free software released under the GNU General Public
License (GPL), see the file [`COPYING`](COPYING) for details.

For testing purposes you can just run `/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qmlscene
qml/pan-transit.qml`. For installation, you probably want an
RPM-package; for instructions on building that, see relevant parts from
the file [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md).
